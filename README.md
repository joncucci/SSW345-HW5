# SSW345-HW5 Reflection

## Design
1.) Thinking about design principles allows for your team to discuss what the long term and short term goals of a project are, and in the process gaining a deeper understanding of your project.
2.) The most difficult part of our development process was assigning tasks to different developers. This is because some developers have strengths who are other's weaknesses and vice versa. Assigning tasks to the correct people that will provide the highest efficiency is the true difficulty
3.) An approach I would like to continue is most likely Scrum, it seems the most flexible and allows for errors, which in return is just learning. Additionally, it is the SDLC I will be using this summer at my internship.

## Implementation
1.) The most helpful thing for our implementing had to be reading actual documentation on our Discord API, which none of us had experience prior. Testing was great because we were able to make our own Discord channel and mute it so it wouldnt annoy other teammates. Finally, GitHub was amazing for integration, as per usual.
2.) The most dofficult part of this was definitely still learning the Discord API, which is pretty different than anything we have done before, however the most rewarding. If I were to change something of this project though, it would probably be to use a different Database to store our information.
3.) For future projects, I would like to try some actual testing and integration software, like PyUnit and ensure more continuous integration techniques

## Process
1.) Kanban is almost CRUCIAL for team projects. Our team works together in other classes and we always assign and create tasks on a kanban board. It allows us to know what we still need to do, what is done, or what is inbetween. It's an organization technique that really allows for a smoother development process. 
2.) As I mentioned previously, the most difficult part of this process was reading and learning the documentation on how to use the Discord API. It was not a massive learning curve by any chance, yet was still the most unknown and important part.
3.) I would love to continue the use of kanban boards for task organization, as well as the use of a team discord or slack server to allow for organized communication.

## Overall
Using a Agile approach with Scrum allowed us to continuously integrate (for the most part), to work on different tasks at the same time as a team and to debug as we went along with testing. Doing this in a different Software Development Life-Cycle, like waterfall for example, would not allow us to develop, debug, integrate, and deliver tasks as frequently as we have been, which would have been an issue because many of our functions are built to work together, not on top of each other, which is what a waterfall SDLC would be more like. I do like, however, that the main idea of waterfall is to get it done right, the first time around. Following this would be crucial for us, as without small edge case testing, any server who had our bot loaded could have obtained information from another.
